# wlan-test
*wlan-test* is a simple program to test the Windows Native Wi-Fi API. It functions as a basic example for enumerating all Wi-Fi interfaces, requesting a refresh on the list of available networks for each interface, and printing out the names of all of the available networks (including detection of hidden networks).
